# `zk-starter`

The easiest way to integrate succinct verifiable on-chain computation using hidden information in custom applications that execute on a credibly-neutral immutable public ledger.

Essentially, it's [__zero knowledge__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) for those with zero knowledge.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/cawfree/zk-starter`.
2. Make sure you've installed [__Rust__](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [__Foundry__](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry):

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh # install rust
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash # install foundry
```
3. Run `yarn`, which will install [`circom`](https://docs.circom.io/) and automate a new [__Powers of Tau__](https://zkproof.org/2021/06/30/setup-ceremonies/#:~:text=The%20first%20phase%20referred%20to,NP%2Drelation%2Dspecific%20CRS.) ceremony and compile your circuits.
 
> All the build artifacts are cached, so you'll only be required to do this once-per-installation. If you'd like to use a larger number of constraints for your `.ptau`, you can download and verify results from public ceremonies [__here__](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mn47gnepqu88mzl/AACaJkBU7mmCq8uU8ml0-0fma?dl=0).

4. Finally, run `yarn dev` to execute the entire stack on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). This will redeploy the auto-generated [__verifier logic__](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/proving-circuits/) made available to your [__smart contracts__](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) on the local chain ([`anvil`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)) and inject the relevant configuration properties into your frontend.
